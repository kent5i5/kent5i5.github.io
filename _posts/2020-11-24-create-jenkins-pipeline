* install jenkin https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/docker/#setup-wizard

* After installation, Click open Blueocean

* In Blueocean, we can create new pipeline by connecting github to it. 

    - The token is generated in github-setting-develop setting-Personal access token 
    Follow the links, it will select the necessary permissions: 
    repo:status, public_repo, admin:repo_hook, read:user, user:email

    >> select repo for full access for private repositories

    - Choose a repo and create a basic pipeline, the pipeline is not working since a jenkinsfile
    is required for pipeline to define stages and run.

* List of stages, jenkins pipeline
    - link codes to check syntax
    - build the app
    - testing
    - deploy: blue/green, production, etc

* Example jenkinsfile
